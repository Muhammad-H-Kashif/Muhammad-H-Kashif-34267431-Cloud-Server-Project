S.Mcconnell, Code Complete, 2nd Edition: 
This book’s focus on implementing Refactoring as a major aim during coding, convinced me to make my code as minimialistic and modular as possible so that it can be easily modified and added upon. Most of my design philosophy was inspired from this book. 

“PPP – Darknet Diaries,” Darknetdiaries.com, 2019. https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/43/ (accessed June. 01, 2024).  : The video’s story about capture the flag tournaments inspired me to build a rudimentary project designed around the same core concepts; a vulnerable system where the user knows has been left deliberately vulnerable and through which they can use exploits to get in if they know how.

A.B. Downey, Think Python. “O’Reilly Media, Inc.,” 2012.   : 
B.Nearly all of my programming skills for this project were learned from this book. And I refactored a large chunk of my answers to the book’s exercises into my code for this project.
